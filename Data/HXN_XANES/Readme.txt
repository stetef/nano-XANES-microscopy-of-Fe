1. nanoXANES_Fe.tiff --> nano-XANES stack collected at HXN beamline 
2. energy_list_corr.txt --> energy values corresponding to the stack
3. FeLibNov2021.nor --> normalized Fe-XANES library (from AthenaProgram)
4. ExpectedResult.png --> Result from linear combination fitting of XANES data

Notes.

1. This is a model system sample used for optimizing nano-XANES workflow. We know the "true value" chemical state map. 
2. The aggregate is composed of LiFe(II)PO4 (LFP), Pyrite (Pyr), StainlessSteelNP (SS) and Hematite_NP (Hem) 
3. Please note that this is unpublished data from a submitted MS
